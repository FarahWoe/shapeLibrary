Interfaces

Class can include multiple interfaces, C# doesn't support inheritance of multiple classes.

Interface members are public by default.
When a class implements an interface, the class must provude an implementation for all the members.

Interfaces can inherit from one or more interfaces. The derived interface inherits the members from its base interfaces. A class that implements a derived interface must implement all members in the derived interface, including all members of the derived interface's base interfaces.
